# Realignment
 2015 Realignment Proposal

## Summary <br/>

Santa Clara Valley Medical Laboratory workload has tripled by 2003 but we have only added twenty-three employees as a whole.  This includes Laboratory Scientists, administrative personnel, pathology, cytology, and other supporting staffs.  Medical Laboratory Assistants have been experiencing shortness of staff which leads to employee burnout, work-related medical leave, and overall lack of comradery in the department.  Patient care significantly decreases from lack of unity between health-care providers. <br/>

We believe that this is due to inability to recruit reputable employees with our salaries.  From our research, we have discovered that our starting pay is 20.7% below the average to comparable hospitals from the area.  With Employer Paid Member Contribution (EPMC), our salaries are still below the average.  We’ve compared ourselves to other Laboratory Assistants or Phlebotomists from Regional/Good Samaritan, Washington, San Francisco County, and El Camino and Kaiser Hospital. 

The Medical Laboratory Assistants at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center would like to ask for a 25% realignment for the whole series.  This will put us in the average and compatible to other local hospitals and hence our ability to attract good employees.  <br/>

The importance of hiring Laboratory Assistants is significant.  Numerous research have shown that having a professional phlebotomist greatly decrease the rate of contamination.  Hence, decrease wasteful spending on corrections and patient hospital stay.  According to Dr. Rita Gander research from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical, using phlebotomists instead of nurses to collect blood reduces patient charges of approximately $4.1 million per year, not to mention the salaries to pay phlebotomist versus nurses is 1/3 to ¼.  For the first quarter of 2015 at SCVMC, it is estimated $1.1 million was spent on blood culture contamination alone.
